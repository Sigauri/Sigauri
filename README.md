Hello, my name's Ibrahim. I am Studying Software-development and am interested more in low-level stuff. Currently learning compiler design
and trying to write one(In C; I don't have much experience with other languages, sadly) as i learn. I am planning to learn .NET and C# and do some 
projects with it too(because it seems to be pretty useful and it is also the language we're going to learn in college).

I also have some knowledge in Electronics and basic things about Compter architecture. I know how numbers are represented in binary system,
know about logic gates, know about ALUs(Would like to build one on breadboards btw.) and also know basic things about how memory works(latches,
flip-flops and all). I don't have much experience actually building these things, a 3-bit adder is all i've implemented till now. However, 
i am planning to dive more into it in the near future. 

I would also like to get some experience in teamwork. So, if you have an interesting project and need a C programmer, here's how you can contact me:
