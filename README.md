Hello, my name's Ibrahim. I am studying Software-development and am interested more in low-level stuff. Currently learning compiler design
and trying to write one(In C. I don't have much experience with other languages, sadly) as i learn. I am planning to learn .NET and C# and do some 
projects with it too(because it seems to be pretty useful).

I also have some knowledge in Electronics and basic things about Computer architecture. 

That's all. Have a nice day and stay healthy!
