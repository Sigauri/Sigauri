Hello, my name's Ibrahim. I am Studying Software-development and am interested more in low-level stuff. Currently learning compiler design
and trying to write one(In C; I don't have much experience with other languages, sadly) as i learn. I am planning to learn .NET and C# and do some 
projects with it too(because it seems to be pretty useful).

I also have some knowledge in Electronics and basic things about Computer architecture. I know how numbers are represented in binary system,
about logic gates, about ALUs(Would like to build one on breadboards) and also basic things about how memory works(latches,
flip-flops and all). 
I would also like to get some experience in teamwork. So, if you have an interesting project and need a C programmer, here's how you can contact me:
